# PredictionAssignment
Project for Practical Machine Learning course (Data Science).

Goal of this project is to obtain a model that allows to predict how did a group of participants a weight lifting exercise In this project, the goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants.

To do so, different models have been considered, obtaining a random forest model as a best model, and validated with a testing set. Variations of this model with the data of a subgroup of participants have been considered to investigate the out of sample error.
